* Maven Shade EDN transformer plugin
  
When Clojure starts, it searches for files named 'data_readers.clj' and 'data_readers.cljc' at the root of the classpath. Each such file must contain a literal map of symbols, like this:

#+begin_src clojure
{foo/bar my.project.foo/bar foo/baz my.project/baz}
#+end_src

This is a transformer for the Maven Shade plugin that collects Clojure data readers found in dependencies during the assembly of a fat jar. All individual data readers from dependencies are assembled together and placed at the root of the current project.
